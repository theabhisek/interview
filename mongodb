 ``````````````````Mongodb``````````````````````
 MongoDB is a cross-platform document-based database. Categorized as a NoSQL database, MongoDB avoids the conventional table-oriented relational database structure in support of the JSON-like documents with the dynamic schemas, making the data integration in specific kinds of applications quicker and simpler.
A compliant data model in the format of documents.
Agile and extremely scalable database.
Quicker than traditional databases.
Demonstrative query language.
MongoDB is a document-oriented database. It stores the data in the form of the BSON structure-oriented databases.
 We store these documents in a collection.
 
 `````````````````````replica`````````````````````
 We can specify the replica as a set of the mongo instances which host a similar data set. 
 In the replica set, one node will be primary, and another one will be secondary.
 We replicate all the data from the primary to the secondary nodes.
 
 primary and secondary replica
 In MongoDB, primary nodes are the nodes that accept writing. Primary nodes are also called master nodes. Replication in MongoDB is a single master. Therefore, only one node will accept the write operations at once.
 Primary Replica Set receives all the write operations from the clients. Secondary replica sets replicate the primary replica sets and implement the operations for their datasets so that secondary datasets affect the primary datasets.
 
 
 ````````````````````````````````````````` Storage encryption ````````````````````````````````
 Storage encryption encodes all the MongoDB data over the storage or over the operating systems for assuring that only authenticated processes will access the safeguarded data.
 
 ```````````````````````````````````````GridFS````````````````````
 
 GridFS: We use GridFS to retrieve and store large files like images, videos, and audio files.
 
Journaling: We use Journaling for secure backups in MongoDB.We save the write operations in the memory while journaling is taking place. 
		The on-disk journal files are dependable for the reason that journal writers are usual. 
		In the DB path, MongoDB designs a journal subdirectory.
