#####################################Venue Booking applictation#############
Venue booking application is a web application in which  any vendor can post venues like hotel,land ,marriage gardern and more.
then it can be booked by users for a certain period.
This makes the workload simple for users to book an venue and they can also search for other things as well.
In this application, the user needs to be registered and login then users will 
search for venues by giving the location if the venues were present in the particular location
The user will see the full information about the venue and if he is interested and if it  is available according to the date then they can carry on with the booking.
I have created various API's to book a particular venues,

Admin:
	Admin needs to login into the application using the Customer name and password and
    he can view the registered Customers and registered Dealers. Admin can also view them.

Dealer:
    The dealer needs to register the application before getting logged in. after getting login the application welcomes Dealer with Dealer home screen, showing the functionalities of Dealer.
    He can add venues and view the Customer requests and accepts.

Customer:
	Customer need to be registered into the application before getting logged in, after getting the login access Customer will search for the venues based on the location, Customer will select the address. Then Customer will see the list of asset available in that location and Customer can book any one of them and then the request will be forwarded to Dealer.

##################################**gym fit**##########
It is an appointment management system with NodeJS that can be used by  a user to fix an appointment with the instructor.
Instructor will have the power to create different time slots in which instructor is free to have a training session.
    This application will store customer data, so it  must have a secure database to keep this information.
    we also integrated payment gateway to have secure payment.
  
################################**invest it**#####################################
the project is based on investment ,there are mainly two type of investment fixed deposite and  flexible deposite 
fixed deposite  is the type of deposite in which your money got locked for a time period 
for example you have selected plan A that is your three month duration and invested percentage is 10 % so whatever the amount you invest you can withdraw after 3 month  and you will get intrest everyday according to intrest.
and fexible deposite is that you can withdraw at any time and the rest is same as above.
in this application user can withdrwal money in the paypal account very easily it is very user friendly and secure for transactions .
then you have following options admin dashboard ,transaction history ,block user ,user management
and I have created some of these apis along with user authetication, authorization
paytm gatway implementation and ragorpay  payment gateway

Thank you
