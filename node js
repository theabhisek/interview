moduls 
In Node.js Application, a Module can be considered as a block of code that provide a simple or complex functionality that can communicate with external application. Modules can be organized in a single file or a collection of multiple files/folders.

	Express, connect, socket.io and SockeJS, pug, MongoDB and Mongojs, Redis, Lodash, forever, bluebird, moment are some of the npm modules.

	Core Modules:http,assert,fs,path,process,os
	
	http	creates an HTTP server in Node.js.
	assert	set of assertion functions useful for testing.
	fs	used to handle file system.
	path	includes methods to deal with file paths.
	process	provides information and control about the current Node.js process.
	os	provides information about the operating system.
	querystring	utility used for parsing and formatting URL query strings.
	
	url	module provides utilities for URL resolution and parsing.
*******************what is node js *******


Why is Node.js Single-threaded?
Node.js is single-threaded for async processing. By doing async processing on a single-thread under typical web loads, more performance and scalability can be 		achieved instead of the typical thread-based implementation.


*************************thraed pool**********************************
In Node. js there are two types of threads: one Event Loop (aka the main loop, main thread, event thread, etc.),
 and a pool of k Workers in a Worker Pool (aka the threadpool). 
 If a thread is taking a long time to execute a callback (Event Loop) or a task (Worker), we call it "blocked".
 
 
Thread pools are often used in server applications to improve performance by creating a thread pool (with a max threshold) that
 can be used to service requests on demand, rather than creating a new thread for each request. 
 For example, a web server takes advantage of thread pool to serve requests.



###########################first call back error#########################
Error-first callback in Node. js is a function that returns an error object whenever any successful data is returned by the function. The first argument is reserved for the error object by the function. This error object is returned by the first argument whenever any error occurs during the execution of the function.
The first argument in the function is reserved for the error object. If any error has occurred during the execution of the function, it will be returned by the first argument.
The second argument of the callback function is reserved for any successful data returned by the function. If no error occurred then the error object will be set to null. 	
**********************************repl###########################
The Node.js Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL) is an interactive shell that processes Node.js expressions. The shell reads JavaScript code the user enters, evaluates the result of interpreting the line of code, prints the result to the user, and loops until the user signals to quit.

The REPL is bundled with every Node.js installation and allows you to quickly test and explore JavaScript code within the Node environment without having to store it in a file.
#############################################cli#####################
Command-line interfaces (CLIs) built in Node.js allow you to automate repetitive tasks while leveraging the vast Node.js ecosystem. And thanks to package managers like npm and yarn, these can be easily distributed and consumed across multiple platforms.
A command-line interface (CLI) is a text-based user interface (UI) used to run programs, manage computer files and interact with the computer. Command-line interfaces are also called command-line user interfaces, console user interfaces and character user interfaces.
**************************************************************buffer**************************************************************************************************
js is used to perform operations on raw binary data. Generally, Buffer refers to the particular memory location in memory. 
Buffer and array have some similarities, but the difference is array can be any type, and it can be resizable. 
Buffers only deal with binary data, and it can not be resizable

*******************************************************EventEmitter*******************************
Node. js uses events module to create and handle custom events. The EventEmitter class can be used to create and handle custom events module..
// Importing events
const EventEmitter = require('events');
   
// Initializing event emitter instances 
var eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();
  
// Registering to myEvent 
eventEmitter.on('myEvent', (msg) => {
   console.log(msg);
});
  
// Triggering myEvent
eventEmitter.emit('myEvent', "First event");

listener:
An event listener is a procedure in JavaScript that waits for an event to occur. The simple example of an event is a user clicking the mouse or pressing a key on the keyboard.

####************************************************child process****************************************
exec() method: This method runs a command in a console and buffers the output.
spawn() method: This method launches a new process with a given command.
fork() method: This method is a special case of spawn() method to create child processes.

########################event loop##################
Node.js is a single-threaded application, but it can support concurrency via the concept of event and callbacks. Every API of Node.js is asynchronous and being single-threaded, they use async function calls to maintain concurrency Node thread keeps an event loop and whenever a task gets completed, it fires the corresponding event which signals the event-listener function to execute.
